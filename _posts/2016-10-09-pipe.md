|Command using Pipes|Meaning or Use of Pipes|
|`ls | more`|Outpur of ls command is given as input to more command So that output is printed one screen full pagee at a time|
|`who | sort`|Output of who command is given as input to sort command So that it will print sorted list of users|
|`who | sort > user_list`|Same as above except output of sort is send to (redirected)user_list file|
|`who | wc -l`|Output of who command is given as input to wc command So that it will number of user who logon to system|

# Filter
If a Linux command accepts its input from the standard input and produces its output on standard is know as a filter.A filter performs some kind of process on the input and gives output.
e.g.. Suppose you have file called `hotel.txt` with 100 lines data, And from `hotel.txt` you would like to print contains from line number 20 to line number 50 and store this result to file called  `hlist` then give command:
{% highlight bash %}
tail +20 < hotel.txt | head -n30 > hlist
{% endhighlight %}


# What is Processes

Process defined as:
"A process is program(command given by user) to perform specific Job. In Linux when you start process, it gives a number to process(called PID or process-id), PID starts from - to 65535."

# Why Process required
As you know Linux is multi-user, multitasking OS. It means you can run more than two process simultaneously if you wish.
